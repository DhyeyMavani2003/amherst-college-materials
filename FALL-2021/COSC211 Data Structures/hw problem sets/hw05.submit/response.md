**1. Plot the first collision times as a function of n for a wide range of values of n. Be sure to do multiple trials for each n and report the maximum, minimum, and average values reported. How does the first collision time appear to scale with n? Linearly? Constant? Something in between?**

Answer: The first Collision Times appear to scale linearly with n. The max, min and average times also appear to scale linearly with n.

**2. For the case n = 365, we can interpret the balls into bins process as follows: each i corresponds to a day of the year, and each ball represents a person’s birthday (assuming birthdays are evenly distributed throughout the year). Thus, a collision occurs when two people have the same birthday. According to your simulations, approximately how many people need to be in a class before we’d expect two people in the class to share a birthday? Is your result surprising?**

Answer: According to my simulations, we will need around 25 people in the classroom before we would expect two people in the class to share a birthday. My result is surprising because this number is so small.

**3. For a wide range of values of n, plot the maximum occupancy of n bins after n trials as a function of n. Again, perform several simulations for for each n and plot the maximum, minimum, and average values you see. How quickly does this occupancy appear to grow?**

Answer: The first maximum occupancy stays almost constant across n. The max, min and average times also appear to remain almost costant with change in n.

**4. Now do the same for the “power of two choices” version of the random process. How quickly does the occupancy appear to grow? How different is the maximum occupancy for this simulation from the previous (without power of two choices)?**

Answer: The maximum occupancy is generally lesser in case of "power of two choices" method than "Without power of two choices". The maximum occupancy is almost constant in wide range of value of n.

**5. For a wide range of values of n, plot the number of trials needed until all bins have occupancy at least 1. How quickly does this function appear to grow? (It might be helpful to graph the number of trials divided by n to see if the growth is linear or super-linear).**

Answer: The growth of number of trials needed until all bins have occupancy atleast one in this case is linear with respect to n as we can see in the graph. We can also see in the second graph of (trials/n) vs n that the growth is very linear because the slope of the trials vs n graph (=trials/n) is almost constant while being slightly increasing.

**6. What data structure did you use?**

Answer: Integer Array
