I completed my teacherâ€™s response draft during the writing studio event. I tried to organize my ideas better in the draft so that I can take my writing to the next level in terms of organization. Before the writing studio event, I had the peer review draft along with comments from my wonderful peers. I tried to make my writing more linked to the theories discussed in class. I had a lot of piecewise analysis of the clip in my peer response draft, so making it linked to the theories discussed in class was all about prioritization during my time at the writing studio. 

Writing in solidarity with others was so much fun and I really loved the times I kept going with the flow and pace of the symphony of key clicks throughout the room. I intrinsically felt more motivated to write and get my essay together as everyone was working towards the same goal. Moreover, I saw people getting stuck, struggling, and scratching their heads, and this in turn made me realize that I am not the only one who at times finds writing difficult to keep pace with./
I met with professor Reardon after submitting my teacher response draft, and I got a lot of constructive suggestions from her side. Hence, I look forward to incorporating those suggestions into my essay so that I can fix my errors and improve on my writing step by step.

This is the updated version of my earlier submission of the same writing studio event. Please update my response for the same writing studio event to count as an engagement unit.
