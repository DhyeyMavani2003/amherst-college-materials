I completed my teacherâ€™s response draft during the writing studio event. I tried to organize my ideas better in the draft so that I can take my writing to the next level in terms of organization. Before the writing studio event, I had the peer review draft along with comments from my wonderful peers. I tried to make my writing more linked to the theories discussed in class. I had a lot of piecewise analysis of the clip in my peer response draft, so making it linked to the theories discussed in class was all about prioritization during my time at the writing studio.
