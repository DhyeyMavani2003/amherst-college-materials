                "Implement Pollard's factoring algorithm, and use it to attempt to break $96$-bit RSA encryption. More specifically: you should write a function $\\texttt{pollardRSA(N,e,c)}$ that takes an RSA public key $(N,e)$ and ciphertext $c$, and attempts to extract the plaintext. For the grading test-cases, I have generated $96$-bit RSA moduli {\\it without making any effort to choose strong primes}; as a result, some of these moduli are more susceptible to Pollard's algorithm than others. However, many cases will not be unually susceptible to Pollard, so {\\it for full points on this problem your code only needs to solve $10$ of the $50$ test cases.} But you may enjoy trying variations on Pollard's algorithm (or another factoring algorithm altogether) to see how many test-cases you are able to solve. I will enable an ``leaderboard'' on Gradescope to show the five highest scores obtained (your real name will not be used if you don't wish to use it; Gradescope will allow you to choose a pseudonym for the leaderboard).\n",

                "The sample cases (from the testing notebook) will include a few smaller cases to help debug your program, then ten $96$-bit cases that I have specifically chosen to be susceptible to Pollard. So the sample cases will give you a sense of whether Pollard's algorithm is implemented well, but don't necessarily indicate that it will pass all of the cases on Gradescope.\n"
